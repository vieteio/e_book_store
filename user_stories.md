# E-book Marketplace Company User Stories

## Content Ingestion Process

### User Story
As a content specialist at the e-book marketplace company, I want to ingest a new e-book manuscript into our platform so that it can be made available for purchase and reading by our customers.

### Initial Context
- I have received a new manuscript from an author in EPUB format.
- The author has provided basic metadata (title, author name, genre, description) via our web form.
- Our content ingestion software is up and running, connected to all necessary systems (MongoDB, AWS S3, CloudFront, DRM service).

### Final Result
- The e-book is available in our content catalog, readable on all supported devices.
- Complete and accurate metadata is stored in our database.
- The e-book is protected by our DRM system.
- The e-book is distributed to our content delivery network.
- The author is notified of successful ingestion and provided with a preview link.

### Steps and Software Operations

1. **Manuscript Upload**
   - I log into the admin interface of our content ingestion software.
   - I create a new ingestion job, inputting the basic metadata provided by the author.
   - I upload the EPUB file through the interface.
   - The software acknowledges receipt and initiates the ingestion process.

2. **Format Validation and Conversion**
   - The software automatically detects the file format (EPUB).
   - It runs a series of validation checks to ensure the EPUB meets our standards.
   - The software converts the EPUB to our proprietary format, optimizing it for our reading applications.
   - If any issues are detected during validation or conversion, the software flags the job for manual review and notifies the appropriate team members via email and Slack.

3. **Metadata Extraction and Enrichment**
   - The software extracts additional metadata from the EPUB file (e.g., table of contents, chapter titles).
   - It cross-references the extracted metadata with the author-provided metadata, flagging any discrepancies.
   - The software enriches the metadata by generating keywords and categorizing the book based on its content.
   - All metadata is stored in our MongoDB database, linked to the unique identifier assigned to this e-book.

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - The software performs automated QA checks, including:
     - Spelling and grammar check using NLP libraries
     - Formatting consistency check
     - Image quality assessment
   - If the book meets certain criteria (e.g., from a bestselling author), the software routes it to a human QA queue.
   - I review the QA results in the admin interface and make any necessary adjustments.

5. **DRM Application**
   - The software initiates a call to our DRM service.
   - The DRM service applies our standard protection layer to the e-book.
   - The software receives the protected version of the e-book and verifies its integrity.

6. **Content Distribution**
   - The software uploads the DRM-protected e-book to our AWS S3 bucket.
   - It then triggers a distribution job to replicate the e-book across our CloudFront CDN.
   - The software verifies successful distribution by checking availability in key geographic regions.

7. **Catalog Update and Notification**
   - The software updates our content catalog database, marking the new e-book as available.
   - It generates a unique preview link for the author.
   - The software sends an automated notification to the author with ingestion confirmation and the preview link.
   - It also notifies relevant internal teams (e.g., marketing) about the new addition to our catalog.

8. **Analytics Update**
   - The software updates our internal analytics, recording:
     - New content addition
     - Genre and category information
     - Processing time and any issues encountered during ingestion

Throughout this process, the software provides real-time status updates in the admin interface, allowing me to monitor progress and quickly address any issues that require human intervention.
